This is a tool to count number of sequences in your fasta file.
I wrote this script because i had some fasta files downloaded by someone else who doesn't remember the number of sequences for each file.

How to use:
Script should be in the same directory with your fasta files.
Then when the scritp is called, it will give the number of sequences for each Fasta file in the directory.

Test Run:
Example directory contain all files required for test run.
Example directory contains 16 different fasta file.
Results.txt contains the number of sequences of those fasta files.
Before using the script please test with example files and check the results.
