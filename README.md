This is a tool to count number of sequences in your fasta file.
Script should be in the same directory with your fasta files.
Then when the scritp is called, it will give the number of sequences for each Fasta file in the directory.
Example directory contains 16 different fasta file.
Results.txt contains the number of sequences of those fasta files.
Before using the script please test with example files and check the results.
